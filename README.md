============

Installation
------------

    $ npm install pigeonkeeper


Quick Start
-----------

    var PigeonKeeper = require("pigeonkeeper");
    var GenericService = require("./node_modules/pigeonkeeper/lib/genericService");

    var mySharedData = {a:1, b:2};

    function finalCallback(err, data)
    {
        console.log("Current PK version: " + pk.getVersion());

        if(err)
        {
            console.log("In app.finalCallback, error object: " + JSON.stringify(err));
            console.log(pk.overallStateAsString());
            console.log(pk.getResults());
        }
        else
        {
            console.log("In app.finalCallback: all tasks are complete!");
            console.log(pk.overallStateAsString());
            console.log(pk.getResults());
        }
    }

    // Create generic services...
    var svc7 = new GenericService("7");
    var svc5 = new GenericService("5");
    var svc3 = new GenericService("3");

    var svc9 = new GenericService("9");
    var svc10 = new GenericService("10");


    var pk = new PigeonKeeper("MyPigeonKeeper", finalCallback, false, 5);

    // The digraph we're about to create matches the example given at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sort
    // Create vertices and associate processes
    pk.addVertex("7", svc7, svc7.doStuff);

Introduction
------------

### What is PK? ###

* A JS object for orchestrating the execution of processes or services


### What PK is NOT ###

* A workflow system
* A visual programming language


Concepts
--------

### Digraphs ###

* Short for "directed graphs"
* Consists of vertices and directed edges

![Example of a Digraph](https://developers.adp.com/PK/Digraph01.png "Example of a Digraph")

### Vertices ###
Each vertex has…

* An ID
* A data object
* A state (more about this later)


### Directed Edges ###

* Think: an arrow between two vertices
* Specified by a start vertex and an end vertex
* Parallel edges are NOT allowed


### Directed Acyclic Graph ###

* A digraph without cycles or self-loops
* Abbreviated DAG

![Example of a DAG](https://developers.adp.com/PK/AcyclicDigraph01.png "Example of a DAG")

From: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sort "Wikipedia article on Topological Sort")

### Topological Sort ###

* An ordering of the vertices so that any vertex appears after its parents
* Not possible in digraphs with cycles (hence our focus on DAGs)
* Topological ordering need not be unique!

### Example ###
<table>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top"><img src="https://developers.adp.com/PK/AcyclicDigraph01.png" /></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top">Some topological orderings of this DAG include:
<ul>
<li>7, 5, 3, 11, 8, 2, 9, 10 (visual left-to-right, top-to-bottom)</li>
<li>3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 2, 9, 10 (smallest-numbered available vertex first)</li>
<li>3, 7, 8, 5, 11, 10, 2, 9 (because we can)</li>
<li>5, 7, 3, 8, 11, 10, 9, 2 (fewest edges first)</li>
<li>7, 5, 11, 3, 10, 8, 9, 2 (largest-numbered available vertex first)</li>
<li>7, 5, 11, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10 (attempting top-to-bottom, left-to-right)</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sort

### Kahn's Algorithm ###

* Used by PK for performing topological sort
* Run time is O(|V| + |E|) where:
*     |V| is number of vertices
*     |E| is number of directed edges
* Operates by removing parentless vertices (think: onion peeling)
* Finite acyclic digraphs must always have at least one parentless vertex, if |V| > 1
* Detects cycles!
* Is "destructive," so digraph must be deep-copied


### Processes ###

* A process is a JS EventEmitter
* Things that can happen inside a process:
*     HTTP requests, e.g. getting data from SOR
*     MongoDB or Solr/Lucene interactions
*     File operations
*     Synchronous operations, too
* PK is agnostic about how the results of the process are stored


### More About Processes ###

* Processes have a "start" or "run" or "doStuff" method
* As it goes, PK will call that method...
* ...and will pass in a “SharedData” object
* Processes emit two types of events:
*     "success" – includes data generated by the process
*     "error" – includes error object


### Processes and Vertices ###

* We associate a vertex with a process
* Vertex tells the process when to start running
* Process updates the vertex when the process completes


### Processes and Edges ###

* Process B depends on Process A means...A must be completed in order for B to start
* Example: B uses data fetched by A
* Since we associate processes with vertices, we describe dependencies between the processes with directed edges!


### SharedData ###

* SharedData is an object
* Intended to store config info...
* ...but can be used however the developers want
* Passed to PK when PK is started


### Processes and Shared Data ###

* PK passes (by reference) the SharedData object to each process when PK runs it
* Process can modify that object…
*     When process starts, or...
*     When process ends successfully, or...
*     When process ends in failure
* Idea is that processes can send config info  around from one process to another


### Again, What is PigeonKeeper? PigeonKeeper... ###

* Is a JS object for orchestrating the execution of processes
* Maintains association between vertices and processes
* Maintains dependencies between processes
* Performs topological sort
* Maintains a SharedData object
* Applies state transition rules (more in a sec)
* Runs processes based on state of associated vertices


### Available States ###

Each vertex can be in one of 5 states:

* NOT_READY
* READY
* IN_PROGRESS
* SUCCESS
* FAIL

Distinction between READY and IN_PROGRESS must be maintained if we wish to limit number of processes running in parallel.



### Lifecycle of a Vertex State ###
![Lifecycle of a Vertex State](https://developers.adp.com/PK/StateTransitionRules.png "Lifecycle of a Vertex State")


### Transition Rules ###
NOT_READY → READY when either...

* the vertex has no parents,
* or all parents are in SUCCESS state

READY → IN_PROGRESS

* controlled by PigeonKeeper

IN_PROGRESS → SUCCESS or FAIL

* depends on the process associated with the vertex

FAIL propagates to all children

### Example State Transitions ###

####Step 0####
![Initially, all states are NOT_READY](https://developers.adp.com/PK/StateTransitions00.png "Initially, all states are NOT_READY")

Initially, all states are NOT_READY


####Step 1####
![States without parents become READY](https://developers.adp.com/PK/StateTransitions01.png "States without parents become READY")

States without parents become READY


####Step 2####
![Processes for the READY states are executed, and so states become IN_PROGRESS](https://developers.adp.com/PK/StateTransitions02.png "Processes for the READY states are executed, and so states become IN_PROGRESS")

Processes for the READY states are executed, and so states become IN_PROGRESS


####Step 3####
![Some processes return OK, others fail](https://developers.adp.com/PK/StateTransitions03.png "Some processes return OK, others fail; Corresponding vertices’ states become SUCCESS or FAIL")

Some processes return OK, others fail; corresponding vertices’ states become SUCCESS or FAIL


####Step 4####
![Vertices with SUCCESSful parents become READY; Vertices with FAILed parents also FAIL](https://developers.adp.com/PK/StateTransitions04.png "Vertices with SUCCESSful parents become READY; Vertices with FAILed parents also FAIL")

Vertices with SUCCESSful parents become READY; vertices with FAILed parents also FAIL


####Step 5####
![READY vertices become IN_PROGRESS; FAILure propagates to children (sort of like the welfare state)](https://developers.adp.com/PK/StateTransitions05.png "READY vertices become IN_PROGRESS; FAILure propagates to children (sort of like the welfare state)")

READY vertices become IN_PROGRESS; FAILure propagates to children (sort of like the welfare state)


####Step 6####
![Process associated with vertex 11 is SUCCESSful...](https://developers.adp.com/PK/StateTransitions06.png "Process associated with vertex 11 is SUCCESSful...")

Process associated with vertex 11 is SUCCESSful...


####Step 7####
![...Child vertex 2 becomes READY...](https://developers.adp.com/PK/StateTransitions07.png "...Child vertex 2 becomes READY...")

...Child vertex 2 becomes READY...


####Step 8####
![...then IN_PROGRESS...](https://developers.adp.com/PK/StateTransitions08.png "...then IN_PROGRESS...")

...then IN_PROGRESS...


####Step 9####
![...and finishes SUCCESSfully.](https://developers.adp.com/PK/StateTransitions09.png "...and finishes SUCCESSfully.")

...and finishes SUCCESSfully.


### About FAIL... ###

PigeonKeeper has two ways of handling failure – specified in constructor:

1. Entire PigeonKeeper stops when one vertex FAILs, or...
2. Vertices which depend on a FAILed process are also marked as FAIL, but other processes can continue

Above example used option 2!

Usage Steps
-----------

### Overview ###

* Write processes as event emitters
* Write “finalProcess” method
* Create a PK instance
* Add vertices and associated processes
* Add directed edges
* Start PK!


Important Methods
-----------------

### Constructor ###

    PigeonKeeper(pkName, finalCallback, quitOnFailure, maxNumRunningProcesses, logger, userObject)

* pkName: instance name, which will be modified into a GUID
* finalCallback: function to be called when PK quits
* quitOnFailure: Boolean
*     When true, PK quits when a single process fails
*     When false, PK tries to execute all processes that don’t depend on failed processes
* maxNumRunningProcesses
* logger: a logging mechanism (optional)
* userObject: object for use by logging mechanism (optional)


### Commonly Used Methods ###

To create the digraph and associate processes with vertices, use...

    addVertex(vertexId, service, serviceStart)

    addEdge(startVertexId, endVertexId)

To start PK a'runnin', use...

    start(sharedData)

* Kicks-off the PK (begins applying state transition rules, starts processes, etc)
* sharedData is passed to processes when they are ran
* sharedData is intended to make config info available to the processes
* Processes can modify sharedData
