============

Installation
------------

    $ npm install pigeonkeeper


Quick Start
-----------

    var PigeonKeeper = require("pigeonkeeper");
    var GenericService = require("./node_modules/pigeonkeeper/lib/genericService");

    var mySharedData = {a:1, b:2};

    function finalCallback(err, data)
    {
        console.log("Current PK version: " + pk.getVersion());

        if(err)
        {
            console.log("In app.finalCallback, error object: " + JSON.stringify(err));
            console.log(pk.overallStateAsString());
            console.log(pk.getResults());
        }
        else
        {
            console.log("In app.finalCallback: all tasks are complete!");
            console.log(pk.overallStateAsString());
            console.log(pk.getResults());
        }
    }

    // Create generic services...
    var svc7 = new GenericService("7");
    var svc5 = new GenericService("5");
    var svc3 = new GenericService("3");
    var svc11 = new GenericService("11");
    var svc8 = new GenericService("8");
    var svc2 = new GenericService("2");
    var svc9 = new GenericService("9");
    var svc10 = new GenericService("10");


    var pk = new PigeonKeeper("MyPigeonKeeper", finalCallback, false, 5);

    // The digraph we're about to create matches the example given at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sort
    // Create vertices and associate processes
    pk.addVertex("7", svc7, svc7.doStuff);
    pk.addVertex("5", svc5, svc5.doStuff);
    pk.addVertex("3", svc3, svc3.doStuff);
    pk.addVertex("11", svc11, svc11.doStuff);
    pk.addVertex("8", svc8, svc8.doStuff);
    pk.addVertex("2", svc2, svc2.doStuff);
    pk.addVertex("9", svc9, svc9.doStuff);
    pk.addVertex("10", svc10, svc10.doStuff);

    // Now add edges
    pk.addEdge("7", "11");
    pk.addEdge("7", "8");
    pk.addEdge("5", "11");
    pk.addEdge("3", "8");
    pk.addEdge("3", "10");
    pk.addEdge("11", "2");
    pk.addEdge("11", "9");
    pk.addEdge("11", "10");
    pk.addEdge("8", "9");

    // Kick it!
    pk.start(mySharedData);


Introduction
------------

### What is PK? ###

* A JS object for orchestrating the execution of processes or services


### What PK is NOT ###

* A workflow system
* A visual programming language


Concepts
--------

### Digraphs ###

* Short for "directed graphs"
* Consists of vertices and directed edges


### Vertices ###
Each vertex has…

* An ID
* A data object
* A state (more about this later)


### Directed Edges ###

* Think: an arrow between two vertices
* Specified by a start vertex and an end vertex
* Parallel edges are NOT allowed


### Directed Acyclic Graph ###

* A digraph without cycles or self-loops
* Abbreviated DAG


### Topological Sort ###

* An ordering of the vertices so that any vertex appears after its parents
* Not possible in digraphs with cycles (hence our focus on DAGs)
* Topological ordering need not be unique!


### Kahn's Algorithm ###

* Used by PK for performing topological sort
* Run time is O(|V| + |E|) where:
*     |V| is number of vertices
*     |E| is number of directed edges
* Operates by removing parentless vertices (think: onion peeling)
* Detects cycles!
* Is "destructive," so digraph must be deep-copied


### Processes ###

* A process is a JS EventEmitter
* Things that can happen inside a process:
*     HTTP requests, e.g. getting data from SOR
*     MongoDB or Solr/Lucene interactions
*     File operations
*     Synchronous operations, too
* PK is agnostic about how the results of the process are stored


### More About Processes ###

* Processes have a "start" or "run" or "doStuff" method
* As it goes, PK will call that method...
* ...and will pass in a “SharedData” object
* Processes emit two types of events:
*     "success" – includes data generated by the process
*     "error" – includes error object


### Processes and Vertices ###

* We associate a vertex with a process
* Vertex tells the process when to start running
* Process updates the vertex when the process completes


### Processes and Edges ###

* Process B depends on Process A means...^KA must be completed in order for B to start
* Example: B uses data fetched by A
* Since we associate processes with vertices, we describe dependencies between the processes with directed edges!


### SharedData ###

* SharedData is an object
* Intended to store config info...
* ...but can be used however the developers want
* Passed to PK when PK is started


### Processes and Shared Data ###

* PK passes (by reference) the SharedData object to each process when PK runs it
* Process can modify that object…
*     When process starts, or...
*     When process ends successfully, or...
*     When process ends in failure
* Idea is that processes can send config info  around from one process to another


### Again, What is PigeonKeeper? PigeonKeeper... ###

* Is a JS object for orchestrating the execution of processes
* Maintains association between vertices and processes
* Maintains dependencies between processes
* Performs topological sort
* Maintains a SharedData object
* Applies state transition rules (more in a sec)
* Runs processes based on state of associated vertices


### Vertex Available States ###

Each vertex can be in one of 5 states:

* NOT_READY
* READY
* IN_PROGRESS
* SUCCESS
* FAIL

Distinction between READY and IN_PROGRESS must be maintained if we wish to limit number of processes running in parallel.



Lifecycle of a Vertex State
---------------------------

### Transition Rules ###

NOT_READY &#8594; READY when either...

* the vertex has no parents,
* or all parents are in SUCCESS state

READY &#8594; IN_PROGRESS

* controlled by PigeonKeeper

IN_PROGRESS &#8594; SUCCESS or FAIL

* depends on the process associated with the vertex

FAIL propagates to all children


### About FAIL... ###

PigeonKeeper has two ways of handling failure – specified in constructor:

1. Entire PigeonKeeper stops when one vertex FAILs, or...
2. Vertices which depend on a FAILed process are also marked as FAIL, but other processes can continue



Usage Steps
-----------

### Overview ###

* Write processes as event emitters
* Write “finalProcess” method
* Create a PK instance
* Add vertices and associated processes
* Add directed edges
* Start PK!


Important Methods
-----------------

### Constructor ###

    PigeonKeeper(pkName, finalCallback, quitOnFailure, maxNumRunningProcesses, logger, userObject)

* pkName: instance name, which will be modified into a GUID
* finalCallback: function to be called when PK quits
* quitOnFailure: Boolean
*     When true, PK quits when a single process fails
*     When false, PK tries to execute all processes that don’t depend on failed processes
* maxNumRunningProcesses
* logger: a logging mechanism (optional)
* userObject: object for use by logging mechanism (optional)


### Commonly Used Methods ###

    addVertex(vertexId, service, serviceStart)

    addEdge(startVertexId, endVertexId)

    start(sharedData)

* Kicks-off the PK (begins applying state transition rules, starts processes, etc)
* sharedData is passed to processes when they are ran
* sharedData is intended to make config info available to the processes
* Processes can modify sharedData
